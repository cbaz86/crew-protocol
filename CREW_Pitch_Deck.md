## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### EMERGENCIES ARE GETTING WORSE. ROBOTS CAN HELP. BUT THEY CAN'T COORDINATE.

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Wildfires spread faster than rescue teams can respond
- 50,000+ commercial robots operate in cities today
- During emergencies, they sit idle while people need help
- No system exists to coordinate robots from different companies

**WHAT'S MISSING?**  
A standard protocol for emergency robot coordination.

**VISUAL:** Split screen
- Left: Wildfire photo, overwhelmed firefighters
- Right: Delivery robot sitting idle 100 yards away

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"Last year's California wildfires displaced 180,000 people. Meanwhile, thousands of delivery drones, warehouse robots, and survey drones sat idle—literally within eyesight of the disaster. Why? Because there's no way to ask them for help."

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION

### CREW: Coordinated Robot Emergency Workforce

**HOW IT WORKS:**

**1. EMERGENCY BROADCAST**  
Fire command sends: "Need thermal imaging + debris clearing"

**2. ROBOTS DECIDE**  
Each robot evaluates: Can I help? Is it safe? Am I allowed?

**3. HUMAN COORDINATES**  
Dashboard shows available robots. Dispatcher assigns tasks.

**4. ROBOTS ASSIST**  
Thermal drone locates survivors. Ground bot clears path.

**KEY INSIGHT:** Robots volunteer. Humans decide. No central control.

**VISUAL:** Animated flowchart showing the 4 steps

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"CREW is opt-in, capability-based, and human-led. It's not Skynet—it's a coordination protocol, like how 911 dispatches ambulances from different hospitals."

---

## SLIDE 4: THE TECHNOLOGY

### BUILT ON PROVEN STANDARDS

**CORE TECHNOLOGY:**
- ROS 2 (Industry standard robotics framework)
- DDS (Data Distribution Service - military-grade messaging)
- JWT Authentication (Banking-level security)
- Geo-fencing (GPS-based safety boundaries)
- Zero-trust architecture (Robots verify every command)

**COMPATIBLE WITH:**
✓ Delivery robots (Starship, Kiwibot)  
✓ Industrial drones (DJI, Skydio)  
✓ Warehouse robots (Boston Dynamics, Clearpath)  
✓ Any robot running ROS 2 (90% of commercial robots)

**NO NEW HARDWARE NEEDED.**  
Software-only installation. 10MB. Negligible battery impact.

**VISUAL:** Logos of compatible robot manufacturers

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"This isn't experimental tech. We're using the same frameworks that NASA uses for Mars rovers and the military uses for defense systems."

---

## SLIDE 5: THE DEMO

### WE'VE BUILT IT. IT WORKS.

**FEATURES:**
- Interactive map with emergency zone
- 3 robots responding in real-time
- Live status cards showing battery, ETA, capabilities
- "Connected to ROS" indicator

**LIVE DEMO VIDEO:** [QR code to 3-min video]

**TESTED WITH:**
✓ Simulated wildfire scenario  
✓ Multi-robot coordination (3+ robots)  
✓ Real-time web dashboard  
✓ Capability-based matching  
✓ Geo-fenced operations

**VISUAL:** Your actual dashboard screenshot

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"This isn't a mockup. This is a working system. Right now, I can trigger an emergency and watch robots respond in real-time."

## SLIDE 6: MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### $50 BILLION ROBOTICS MARKET - ZERO COORDINATION INFRASTRUCTURE

**MARKET SIZE:**
- 10M commercial robots by 2030 (20% CAGR)
- $15B emergency services technology market
- 3,000+ cities with >100K population (potential customers)
- Every robot manufacturer needs this

**REVENUE STREAMS:**
1. **Certification:** $50K-$200K per robot model
2. **SaaS Platform:** $5K-$50K/month per city
3. **Consulting:** $100K-$500K per integration
4. **Government Contracts:** $5M-$100M+ (FEMA, DHS)

**TAM: $5B+ by 2030**

**VISUAL:** Bar chart showing market growth

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"Every robot sold after 2028 will need emergency coordination capability. We're building the standard before anyone else even realizes this is a category."

## SLIDE 7: BUSINESS MODEL

### MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS = LOWER RISK

**YEAR 1-2: CONSULTING + GRANTS**
- Integrate CREW into robot fleets: $100K-$500K per client
- SBIR/NSF grants: $250K-$1M (non-dilutive)
- Target: 5-10 clients = $1M-$3M revenue

**YEAR 2-3: SaaS + CERTIFICATION**
- Enterprise dashboard: $5K-$50K/month per city
- Robot certification: $50K-$200K per model
- Target: 20 cities + 10 manufacturers = $5M-$10M revenue

**YEAR 3-5: GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS**
- FEMA pilot program: $5M-$20M
- National rollout: $100M+ over 10 years
- Target: Become prime contractor for emergency robot infrastructure

**UNIT ECONOMICS:**
- Customer acquisition cost: $25K
- Lifetime value: $500K-$5M (multi-year contracts)
- Gross margin: 70-85%

**VISUAL:** Revenue projections chart (hockey stick)

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"We're not picking one business model—we're stacking multiple revenue streams that reinforce each other. Consulting builds relationships. SaaS provides recurring revenue. Government contracts scale it nationally."

## SLIDE 8: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### NO DIRECT COMPETITION. YET.

**POTENTIAL COMPETITORS:**
- Palantir (data platforms, not robotics)
- Anduril (defense robots, not civilian)
- Robot manufacturers (focused on hardware, not coordination)
- Emergency software companies (no robot expertise)

**OUR ADVANTAGES:**
✓ First mover (12-24 month head start)  
✓ Working prototype (not vaporware)  
✓ Open protocol (creates network effects)  
✓ Domain expertise (robotics + emergency response)  
✓ Low switching costs (software-only integration)

**MOAT:**
- Network effects (more robots = more valuable)
- Standards body adoption (IEEE, NIST)
- Government certifications (creates regulatory barrier)
- Brand ("CREW-Certified" becomes table stakes)

**VISUAL:** 2x2 competitive matrix showing you in top-right

**SPEAKER NOTES:**  
"The biggest tech companies could build this, but they won't. Palantir doesn't understand robots. Robot companies don't understand emergency coordination. We're the only team at the intersection."
